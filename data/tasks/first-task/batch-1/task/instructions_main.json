      "In this task, you will be asked to assess the truthfulness of eight statements by means of seven specific quality dimensions.",
      "First, you will be asked to fill in one questionnaire and to answer three questions. Then, we will show you <strong>8 statements</strong> made by popular people (for example, political figures) together with the information of who made the statement\n  and on which date. For each statement, we ask you to search for evidence using our custom search engine and to tell <strong>how much\n  do you agree with considering the statement true in general (as opposed to false)</strong>; that is, its overall truthfulness. We also\n  ask you to mark the evidence found in terms of an URL as well as your self-confidence about the topic, i.e., if you consider\n  <strong>yourself expert / knowledgeable about its topic (as opposed to novice/beginner)</strong>."
