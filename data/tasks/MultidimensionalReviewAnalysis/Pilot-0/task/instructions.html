  In this task, you will be asked to assess the trustworthiness of eight product reviews by means of six specific quality dimensions.
</p>

<p>
  First, you will be asked to fill in one questionnaire and to answer three questions. Then, we will show you <strong>8 product descriptions and corresponding reviews</strong>.
  For each review, we ask you to tell <strong>how much do you agree with considering the review trustworthy
  (as opposed to untrustworthy)</strong>; that is, its overall truthfulness and usefulness. We also ask you to mark your self-confidence about the review topic, i.e., if
  you consider <strong>yourself expert / knowledgeable about its topic (as opposed to novice/beginner)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Then, we ask you to assess six specific <strong>quality dimensions</strong> by stating your level of agreement with them. All your answers are given on a 5 level scale, i.e., they must be selected among 5 different labels: (-2) Completely disagree, (-1)
  Disagree, (0) Neither
  Agree Nor Disagree, (+1) Agree, (+2) Completely Agree. Each quality dimension is detailed in the following list. We provide a sample statement for each dimension so you can familiarize yourself with the six dimensions. Please, note that there are some
  “positive” examples, (i.e., statements that completely agree with the current dimension), and “negative” examples, (i.e., statements that completely disagree with the current dimension). (Keep in mind that the examples are illustrative only, and it is likely
  that you may also need to use the rest of the labels in your answers). The six dimensions we consider are the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reliability</strong>: the review is expressed in a reliable way, as opposed to being incorrect and/or reporting unreliable information</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree): “They fit great, look great, are quite comfortable and are just what I was looking for!.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neutrality</strong>: the review is expressed in a neutral / objective way, as opposed to subjective / biased</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example(which label is: -2 Completely disagree): “Love them!!”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comprehensibility</strong>: the review is comprehensible / understandable / readable as opposed to difficult to understand</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree) “They run big. Order a full size smaller."
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Precision</strong>: the information provided in the review is precise / specific, as opposed to vague</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree): “They run big. Order a full size smaller.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Completeness</strong>: the information reported in the review is complete as opposed to telling only a part of the story</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree): “I actually have 3 pairs of these trainers. They are very comfortable, there is a neoprene sleeve that goes around your ankle that makes them the most comfortable for me compared to normal athletic shoes.
        They run a little narrow - for me this is perfect, but you may want to round up on the size or try on in the store first if your feet are on the wider side.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informativeness</strong>: the review allows us to derive useful information as opposed to simply stating well known facts and/or tautologies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +1 Agree): “Love these shoes! Needed new running shoes and these are perfect. Light weight and fit great!”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, you will be asked to <strong>provide an overall justification</strong> related to your assessments by writing a short paragraph.
</p>

  If you wish to change a previously given judgment, you can use the Back and Next buttons to navigate the task and revisit your answers. Please note that the reviews are not presented in any particular order. You might see many good reviews, many bad ones, or
  any combination. Try not to anticipate, and simply rate each review after reading it. Note that you’ll need to answer <strong>all questions and fill in every field</strong> in order to proceed in the task, otherwise you will not be able to proceed to the following steps.
  Note that there are some quality checks throughout the task, and if you do not perform these correctly you will not be able to terminate the task and get paid. The data from this task is being gathered for research purposes only. Participation is entirely
  voluntary, and you are free to leave the task at any point.
