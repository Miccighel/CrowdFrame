Use the EFFECT button to annotate descriptions of Side Effects, including all adjectives, idioms, slang, mentions of withdrawals, and overdoses. <br />",
      "Note that the annotation buttons are active only if you highlight a portion of text belonging to the tweet. Make sure that your selection does not include any text outside of the tweet text box. <br /><br />",
      "The tweets are presented in no particular order. Simply annotate each tweet after reading it. Don't try to guess or randomly annotate, as there are some cross-checks. Youâ€™ll need to use the buttons to annotate at least one DRUG for each tweet, otherwise you will not be able to proceed to the following steps.<br /><br />",
