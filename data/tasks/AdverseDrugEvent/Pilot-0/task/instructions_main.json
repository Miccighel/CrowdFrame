      "Once you select a portion of text you will be able to <strong>annotate</strong> it by clicking on the <span class='highlighted-green'>DRUG</span> button or on the  <span class='highlighted-orange'>ADV.EFFECT</span> button. <br />Note that the label DRUG includes also medications names and active substances nouns, while the label ADV.EFFECT includes descriptions containing verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, idioms, slang and mentions of withdrawals and overdoses.<br />",
      "Use the DRUG button to annotate medication names and active substances nouns (not dosages). Use the ADV.EFFECT button to annotate descriptions of Adverse Effects, including all adjectives, idioms, slang, mentions of withdrawals and overdoses. <br /><br />",

      "The tweets are presented in no particular order. Simply annotate each tweet after reading it. Don't try to guess or randomly annotate, as there are some cross-checks.
