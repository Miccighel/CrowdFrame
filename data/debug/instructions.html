  In this task, you will be asked to assess the truthfulness of eight statements by means of seven specific quality dimensions.
</p>

<p>
  First, you will be asked to fill in one questionnaire and to answer three questions. Then, we will show you
  <strong>8 statements</strong> made by popular people (for example, political figures) together with the information of who made the statement
  and on which date. For each statement, we ask you to search for evidence using our custom search engine and to tell <strong>how much
  do you agree with considering the statement true in general (as opposed to false)</strong>; that is, its overall truthfulness. We also
  ask you to mark the evidence found in terms of an URL as well as your self-confidence about the topic, i.e., if you consider
  <strong>yourself expert / knowledgeable about its topic (as opposed to novice/beginner)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Then, we ask you to assess seven specific <strong>quality dimensions</strong> by stating your level of agreement with them.
  All your answers are given on a 5 level scale, i.e., they must  be selected among 5 different labels: (-2) Completely disagree,
  (-1) Disagree, (0) Neither Agree Nor Disagree, (+1) Agree, (+2) Completely Agree. Each quality dimension is detailed in the following list.
  We provide a sample statement for each dimension so you can familiarize yourself with the seven dimensions. Please, note that there are some
  “positive” examples, (i.e., statements that completely agree with the current dimension), and “negative” examples, (i.e., statements that
  completely disagree with the current dimension). (Keep in mind that the examples are illustrative only, and it is likely that you may also
  eed to use the rest of the labels in your answers). The seven dimensions we consider are the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Correctness</strong>: the statement is expressed in an accurate way, as opposed to being incorrect and/or reporting  mistaken information</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree): “It’s illegal to treat a minor without parental consent in the U.S. Even as hospitals are limiting visitors, minors will always be allowed to have one guardian present.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neutrality</strong>: the statement is expressed in a neutral / objective way, as opposed to subjective / biased</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example(which label is: -2 Completely disagree): “The Labor Party has repeatedly claimed the Coalition needs to make cuts of $70 billion to vital services to balance the budget.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comprehensibility</strong>: the statement is comprehensible / understandable / readable as opposed to difficult to understand</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree) “Florida ranks first among the nations for access to free prekindergarten."
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Precision</strong>: the information provided in the statement is precise / specific, as opposed to vague</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: -2 Completely disagree): “There were more deaths after the gun bans from guns than there were in the three years before Port Arthur”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Completeness</strong>: the information reported in the statement is complete as opposed to telling only a part of the story</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: -2 Completely disagree): “We inherited a broken test for COVID-19.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speaker's trustworthiness</strong>: the speaker is generally trustworthy / reliable as opposed to untrustworthy / unreliable / malicious</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: -2 Completely disagree): “Says video shows “the Chinese are destroying the 5G poles as they are aware that it is the thing triggering the corona symptoms.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informativeness</strong>: the statement allows us to derive useful information as opposed to simply stating well known facts and/or tautologies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example (which label is: +2 Completely agree): “2019 coronavirus can live for up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, you will be asked to <strong>provide an overall justification</strong> related to your assessments by writing a short paragraph.

  If you wish to change a previously given judgment, you can use the Back and Next buttons to navigate the task and revisit your answers.
  Please note that the statements are not presented in any particular order. You might see many good statements, many bad ones, or any combination.
  Try not to anticipate, and simply rate each statement after reading it. Note that you’ll need to answer <strong>all questions and fill every field</strong> in order
  to proceed in the task, otherwise you will not be able to proceed to the following steps. Note that there are some quality checks throughout the task,
  and if you do not perform these correctly you will not be able to terminate the task and get paid. The data from this task is being gathered for research
  purposes only. Participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to leave the task at any point.
